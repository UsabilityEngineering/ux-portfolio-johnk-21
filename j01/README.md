This is a Homedics TotalClean® 5-in-1 UV-C Large Room Air Purifier. I use this both as an air purifier and as a fan. It’s intended use is to rid the air of pollutants, allergens, mold, and a number of other advertised annoyances. For me it works well during allergy season, which in Chico, can be quite rough. I also find it useful for ridding the house of unwanted smells from cooking or cleaning. 

In my opinion the most important aspect of the device is it’s effectiveness, and it is effective. After cooking a smelly meal, leaving it on in the kitchen will rid the house of any lingering smells in about 30 minutes to an hour. It also works for other smells such as mildew, I have accidentally spilled some water on my floor unnoticed before. After drying the spill and leaving the purifier on for about an hour the smell had greatly diminished. You are supposed to change its filter out every so often according to the manufacturer, but I have gone over the recommended usage and it still seems to be working great. 

The device itself is easy to use. Six different buttons are placed on the top of the device with a gray background compared to the rest of the device's white finish which attracts the eye to where you are supposed to operate it. These aren’t physical buttons, but rather touch sensitive buttons with a black circle around them to indicate where you can press. Even with the lack of physical buttons, I find operation to be satisfying with the little ding sound the device plays when a button is pressed. The only problem I have had with the device is with it’s “light” button. This is a button which has an icon depicting light that has two purposes. It both turns on/off the night light, which is very bright, and it turns on/off the background lighting for the buttons. The problem is if you are trying to sleep in the dark and go to turn off the light coming from the buttons you have to cycle through turning on and then off again the much brighter night light. Not only is this action not immediately learnable, as the button has two operations but there is nothing to indicate this, but it also turns on a very bright light which can be annoying in the middle of the night. 

Overall, I am pleased with this device as it is effective in doing its job as advertised. Its User Experience is also pretty good, but in my opinion most people don’t notice good User Experience, only bad ones.
